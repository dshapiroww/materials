\maketitle

Participants are not allowed to bring the following items to the Ross
Program:
\begin{itemize}
\item Televisions, DVD players, or other video systems,
\item Computers, iPads, tablets, or electronic games,
\item Expensive items or large amounts of cash,
\item Automobiles, bicycles, skateboards, etc.
\end{itemize}

Do not bring valuable items, as there is a possibility for theft. ATMs
are available on campus to Ross Program participants who need to
withdraw cash.

\textbf{Cell Phones:} Students may bring cell phones, but are only
permitted to use them within their own dorm rooms.  Cell phones used
outside of the dorm rooms will be confiscated.

All students are expected to stay in proximity of a Ross Counselor at
all times, and should not leave the campus of the Ohio Dominican University, or go anywhere outside
the dormitory after dark, unless absolutely necessary and in the
company of a Counselor.  Visits and excursions with friends or
relatives are discouraged.  This policy enables students to maintain
the momentum of the program and to build a strong feeling of community
within the dormitory.  If you need to leave the campus in the company
of a friend or family member, a Leave Request Form must be submitted
and approved by the Head Counselor prior to departure.

Standard rules regarding respect and behavior apply in the Ross
Program, just as they do in high schools. This includes times in and
out of the classroom throughout the duration of the summer
program. Please review the \textit{Standards of Behavior} for
additional information on this.
