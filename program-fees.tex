We must receive your program fee prior to arrival in Columbus.  You
may pay program fees by paper check, credit card, or electronic funds
wire transfer.

Program Fees are used to pay for room and board costs, and instructional expenses.
\begin{quote}

\end{quote}  

Participants must pay this program fee prior to \feeduedate.

\subsection*{To pay by Paper Check}

If you reside in the USA, please write a check for \totalfee, payable
in U.S. Dollars, made out to ``Ross Mathematics Foundation'' and
mailed to
\begin{quote}
Ross Mathematics Foundation  \\
1644 Andover Rd \\
Columbus, OH 43212
\end{quote}
U.S. residents should allow at least a week for postal delivery, or
use an express/certified mail delivery service. Do not require
signature confirmation because no one is available to sign for
packages.  Mail from other countries sometimes takes much longer.
Check with your local postmaster for a delivery time estimate.

\textbf{We prefer to receive paper checks.} However, if you live
outside the USA it might be more convenient to pay by another method.

\subsection*{To pay by Credit Card}

%The credit card must be one valid in the United States, with transactions in US Dollars.
%Details will be inserted here when we get the information from our bank.\\

The Ross Mathematics Foundation can receive payments by credit card.
Payments by this method include an additional 5\% convenience fee.
