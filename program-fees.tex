\maketitle
We must receive your program fee prior to arrival in Columbus.  You
may pay program fees by paper check, credit card, or electronic funds wire
transfer. 
{\scriptsize  (Credit card payment has a 5\% surcharge.)}

Program Fees are used to pay for room and board costs, and instructional expenses.
\begin{quote}

{\bf INSTRUCTIONS for paying by Paper Check}

If you reside in the USA, please write a check for \totalfee, payable
in U.S. Dollars, made out to ``Ross Mathematics Program,'' and mailed
to
\begin{quote}
Ross Mathematics Foundation  \\
1644 Andover Rd. \\
Columbus, OH 43212
\end{quote}
U.S. residents should allow at least a week for postal delivery, or
use an express/certified mail delivery service. Mail from other countries
sometimes takes much longer.  Check with your local postmaster for a delivery
time estimate.

\textbf{We prefer to receive paper checks.} However, if you live outside the USA 
it might be more convenient to pay by another method.  \\
