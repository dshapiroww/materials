\maketitle

Participants are not allowed to bring the following items to the Ross
Program:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0pt]
\item Televisions, DVD players, or other video systems,
\item Computers, iPads, tablets, or electronic games,
\item Expensive items or large amounts of cash,
\item Automobiles, bicycles, skateboards, etc.
\end{itemize}


\textbf{Cell Phones:} Turn off all cell phones 
during any Ross classes or mathematical discussions.  For those five weeks, 
we ask campers to {\bf avoid connecting to the internet}. \\
Please postpone internet use (reading, writing, watching videos,
playing games, etc) until you return home. \\
It is OK to use your phone in moderation for sending emails
and text messages to family, and for quick financial transactions.\\

{\bf Photos.} Taking photos of friends and colleagues is a good way to 
preserve memories of good times at the Ross Program.  However:  \\[3pt]
\hspace*{8mm}$\bullet$ Do not photograph people unless you have obtained their permission to do so. \\[3pt]
This is especially important for images you might send to others or post on social media.\\

Students are expected to stay in sight of a Ross Counselor or other authorized adult 
whenever outside of the dormitory. Students should not leave the campus,
% or go outside the dormitory after dark, 
unless provided explicit permission by Ross administrators.  
Visits and excursions with friends or
relatives are discouraged.  

These policies enable Ross students to maintain
the mathematical momentum of the program and to build a strong feeling of community
within the dormitory.  If you need to leave the campus in the company
of an adult friend or family member, a {\it Leave Request Form} must be submitted
and approved prior to departure.\\

Standard rules regarding respect and behavior apply in the Ross
Program, just as they do in high schools. This includes times in and
out of the classrooms, and throughout the five weeks of the summer
program. Please review the \textit{Standards of Behavior} for
additional discussion of this point.
